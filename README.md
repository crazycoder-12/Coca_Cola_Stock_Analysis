# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning
 # 🛠 Problem Description
Accurately forecasting stock prices remains a significant challenge for researchers and financial analysts. Investors and stakeholders consistently seek reliable stock price prediction systems to inform investment decisions and gain insights into future market trends. However, the volatile and complex nature of financial markets makes this task inherently difficult.

# 💡 Proposed Solution
This project leverages multiple Machine Learning (ML) models to forecast stock prices:
➡️LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks 

➡️Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

➡️Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Regressor

➡️Random Forest Regressor

➡️Decision Tree Regressor

The approach includes:-
1. Utilizing historical stock price data and relevant financial indicators
2. Data preprocessing and cleaning
3. Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Building predictive models
        Comparing model performance using accuracy metrics

# 🔍 Alternatives Considered
To further enhance forecasting accuracy, exploration of the following models and techniques has been considered:
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
Ensemble Methods

# 📂 Dataset Source
The historical stock price data used for this project was sourced from Kaggle
